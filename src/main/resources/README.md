# Resources

Resources folders get copied into the final application (jar file), and 
can be accessed at runtime. This is useful for storing configuration files,
such as the console.properties file, or for storing images that are used in the
application. We also have collection.csv which is a cleaned up download
of the BGArena games.

You DO NOT need to modify either of these files.
