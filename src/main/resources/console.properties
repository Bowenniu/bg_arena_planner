*******Welcome to the BoardGame Arena Planner.*******

A tool to help people plan which games they 
want to play on Board Game Arena. 

To get started, enter your first command below, or type ? or help for command options.</entry>
    <entry key="help">
    To work with the BGArenaPlanner, you can filter the BGA games list,  
    add games to your list, remove games from your list, and save your list to a file.
    Filters are progressive, so you can add multiple filters to narrow down the list.

    The following commands are available:
    exit - exit the program
    help or ? [list | filter] - show this help message, Options list - show help for the list command, filter - show help for the filter command.

    <entry key="list_help">
    list [add|remove] [game name|#|#-#] - add or remove a game for the list by game name
        or by specifying the number in the (filter) list. You can specify a range of games using 
        a dash between numbers.

    list clear - clear all games from your games list.

    list save [filename] - save your games list to a file. If no filename is specified, 
    uses the default filename `games_list.txt`.


    Examples:
        list add 1 - add the first game in the list to your games list.
        list add 1-3 - add the first three games in the list to your games list.
        list add 7 wonders - add the game 7 wonders to your games list.
        list remove 1 - remove the first game in the list from your games list.
        list remove 1-3 - remove the first three games in the list from your games list.
        list remove 7 wonders - remove the game 7 wonders from your games list.

    Filter progressively adds filters to the BG Arena List of games, until clear is called.

    filter  - show all games in the list.
    filter clear - clear all filters

    filter [name|maxPlayers|minPlayers|minPlaytime|maxPlaytime|rank|rating|difficulty|year][~=|==|!=|>=|<=|>|<][value] [sort:col asc|desc]- filter the list of games by the 
        specified value on the specified column. Sorted by col either ascending or descending. 
        Defaults to by name ascending if no sort is specified. Can optionally
        add additional filtes by specifying commas between filters.

    The filter operations are as follows: 
        ~= - contains - only available for name
        == - equals
        != - not equals
        >= - greater than or equal to
        <= - less than or equal to
        > - greater than
        < - less than


    Examples:
        filter name~=7 - show all games with a 7 in the name.
        filter maxPlayers>=4 - show all games with 4 or more max players.
        filter minPlayers<=2 - show all games with 2 or fewer min players.
        filter minPlaytime>=30 - show all games with a minimum playtime of 30 minutes.
        filter name~=7, maxPlayers>=4 - show all games with a 7 in the name and 4 or more max players.
        filter name~=7, maxPlayers>=4 sort:rating desc - show all games with a 7 in the name and 4 or more max players, sorted by rating descending.
