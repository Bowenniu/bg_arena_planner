 * Set<BoardGame> as a
 * parameter. This represents the total board game collection.
 * 
 * An important note, while most of methods return streams, each method builds
 * on each other / is
 * progressive. As such if filter by minPlayers, then filter by maxPlayers, the
 * maxPlayers filter
 * should be applied to the results of the minPlayers filter unless reset is
 * called between.

    /**
     * Filters the board games by the passed in text filter.
     * 
     * 
     * A text filter can contain the following options:
     * 
     * > : greater than
     * 
     * < : less than
     * 
     * >= : greater than or equal to
     * 
     * <= : less than or equal to
     * 
     * == : equal to
     * 
     * != : not equal to
     * 
     * ~= : contains the text
     * 
     * The left side of the filter describes the column to filter on. The right side
     * of the filter
     * describes the value to filter on.
     * 
     * Fo example:
     * 
     * minPlayers>4
     * 
     * would filter the board games to only those with a minimum number of players
     * greater than 4.
     * 
     * Commas between filters are treated as ANDs. For example:
     * 
     * minPlayers>4,maxPlayers<6
     * 
     * It is possible to filter on the same column multiple times. For example:
     * 
     * minPlayers>4,minPlayers<6
     * 
     * This would filter the board games to only those with a minimum number of
     * players greater than
     * 4 and less than 6.
     * 
     * Spaces should be ignored, but can be included for readability. For example:
     * 
     * minPlayers > 4
     * 
     * is the same as
     * 
     * minPlayers>4
     * 
     * 
     * If filtering on a string column, the filter should be case insensitive. For
     * example:
     * 
     * name~=pandemic
     * 
     * would filter the board games to only those with the word "pandemic" in the
     * name, but could
     * also have Pandemic or PANDEMIC.
     * 
     * Column names will match the values in GameData. As such is it possible to use
     * 
     * GameData.MIN_PLAYERS.getColumnName() or GameData.fromString("minplayers") to
     * get the
     * column name for the minPlayers column.
     * 
     * Note: id is a special column that is not used for filtering or sorting.
     * 
     * if the filter is empty (""), then the results should return the current
     * filter sorted based
     * on the sortOn column and in the defined direction.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * @param filter    The filter to apply to the board games.
     * @param sortOn    The column to sort the results on.
     * @param ascending Whether to sort the results in ascending order or descending
     *                  order.
     * @return A stream of board games that match the filter.
