## Deeper Thinking

The data for this assignment was downloaded from Board Game Geek, which a person has a unofficial collection of the 
BGArena games. You can see that collection [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/BoardGameArena?rankobjecttype=subtype&rankobjectid=1&columns=title%7Cthumbnail%7Cstatus%7Cbggrating%7Ccomment&geekranks=Board%20Game%20Rank&objecttype=thing&ff=1&subtype=boardgame). It is also worth noting it is actually out of date, since BGGeek has added a category for [Digital Implementations of games](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/70360/digital-implementations-board-game-arena/linkeditems/boardgamefamily).  

Data like this is often available online, and even the owners of Board Game Geek have RPGGeek and VideoGameGeek. They also have a way to access their data directly via an API (Application Programming Interface), which can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2). To try out their API, you can put into the url https://www.boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2/thing?id=13 and you will get back an XML file with information about the game with id 13.

Take some time to find other online data APIs that you might be interested in. What kind of data would you like to work with? What kind of data would be useful for you to have access to? Another example of an API a random dog image API [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)!

:fire: Find at least **two other** APIs/Data sources. Link them, and provide a brief description of what kind of data they provide. These will act as your references for this assignment. 

However, just because information is freely available online, it does not mean
* You have legal rights to that information
* The information was collected ethically
* The information is accurate
* The information is without bias

:fire: Take some time to think about the ethical implications of using data from the internet. What are some ways that you can ensure that the data you are using is accurate and unbiased?  Provide some examples of key questions you might ask yourself before using data in a project, and what are some questions you can use to help you evaluate the data you are using. Please include references if you use any, as there are plenty of articles out there talking about this topic.
